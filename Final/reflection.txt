We were able to complete most all of our features as planned. 
Our fist sprint, we got really far ahead, so we upgraded/ added new
"musts" to the subsequent sprints. Some upgrades included adding classes
and items. So from our originally planned goals we think we were very successful.

Comparing our original idea to the final:
Our original idea I think was a little more tile based, but the final game
ended up being more Zelda like than Pokemon. The combat system evolved
into something a lot more complicated than we originally planned. Having
turn based combat from games like Final Fantasy or Pokemon, yet also having
a 2D combat area, complete with range and in combat movement and repositioning. 

Combat was the biggest change from start to finish. However, it was not a bad
kind of change. Just a lot of "I think we can do this, let's try and see". 
In the end, we are happy with the state of all the systems in the game:
combat, doors and keys, skills etc. But each system only got more complicated
as time went on. 

Our playtests were very useful. The first one allowed us to focus on what kind
of content our players wanted. Like we said above: our systems were very good, 
but the didn't have a lot of interactables yet. So learning what players wanted
or what they didn't want was very helpful to us. 

Our second playtest shown us that, while our systems were complicated and fully
implemented, they were complicated. We quickly learned that players were impressed
with what they were doing, but the didn't understand it. So our goals from then
was to try to make the UI more intuitive, and this had mixed results. Building a 
good UI after the fact is hard. Perhaps we should of developed it as we went along
instead of at the end.
