Playtest notes and main ideas:

Level Design
 - More things to interact with
 - Smaller levels
    - Makes interactables closer
 - Keys need matching doors

UI
 - Skills Bar
 - Scrolling Text in one spot
 - Enemy Health
 - Damage Pop-Ups
 - Highlight targeted enemies

Combat
 - Skills
 - Auto focus enemies
 - Consider having a keyboard only combat selecter
 - Agro radius feels a little arbitrary


Playtest raw notes:
No incentive to fight
	Will be added will levels etc.
Text was a little small for such a high resolution screen
"Never felt in danger"
Clicking on enemies was pretty hard
Most people enjoyed staying in the overworld during combat
Players assumed touching enemies = death
